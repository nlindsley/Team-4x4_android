# Team-4x4_android
Version 1.0
This program is a Legend of Zelda style adventure game featuring 3 demo levels: a combat level, puzzle level, and boss level.
Both a desktop and Android version of the game are being produced using LibGDX. We are using Mitch Davis' (mitchhelp.me)
code from his game lectures presented in 2014 and 2015 as a basis (permission granted) and then building features on top
of that basis. All art, screens, and level designs are our own work.

Credits
4 Byte Warrior was produced by Team 4x4 for Kim Tracy's Team Software Product class Spring 2016.
Team 4x4 consists of Alex Friebe, Nick Lindsley, Ben McWerthy, and Charlie Heckel.

System Requirements:
Desktop Version: A Java compiler. Given the simplistic art and small number of sprites on the screen, the game is not at all
system intensive. Run from the command line (or a Java compiler).
Android Version: To run the game, Android 4.2.2 or higher is need. Launch from the widget.

Configuration:
No configuration is necessary. Simply launch the game via the command line or widget and it will run.
